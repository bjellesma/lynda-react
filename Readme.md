This is a lynda.com course in using react.js

To run:
1. Clone the project

Dependencies:
We are using the react framework from https://facebook.github.io/react/
We are using the Babel Javascript compiler from https://babeljs.io/
    NOTE: you must use Babel 5 as I have it in order for this to work properly
