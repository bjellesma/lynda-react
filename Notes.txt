React is a js framework developed by facebook for use with UIs
Uses a virtual DOM
  it is a javascript object and therefore is much faster to read and write to
  react is so fast because it never reads from the real Dom, only writting to it when changes have been made
Since react.js uses its own DOM, we need special developer tools
Make sure to include the link to the react library by going to the react facebook github page
